# covid-19-prediction
A project on covid-19 diagnosis analysis using python and mysql

 #Python script for data analysis and model building. Here's a summary of the key steps taken:

Importing Libraries: imported various Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

Data Loading and Exploration: loaded a dataset from a CSV file (corona_tested_006.csv) and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using methods like shape, head, tail, info, and describe.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: cleaned the data by handling missing values, renaming columns, and encoding categorical variables.also visualized the data to gain insights into the relationships between different features.

Feature Selection: used the chi-square test for feature selection and explored the correlation between features using a heatmap.

Model Building: implemented machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The accuracy and performance of each model were evaluated on the test set.

Model Comparison: compared the performance of different models using a bar chart, and it appears that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy (96.83%).
